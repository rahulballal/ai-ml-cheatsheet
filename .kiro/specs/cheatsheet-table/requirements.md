# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a static web application that displays the goose-ai-concepts.csv data in an interactive HTML table format. Users will be able to filter the table content based on the concepts column to quickly find specific AI/ML concepts and their definitions. The solution will be a simple, self-contained static website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any external dependencies or frameworks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the CSV data in a well-formatted HTML table, so that I can easily read and understand the AI/ML concepts and their information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webpage loads THEN the system SHALL display all CSV data in an HTML table format
2. WHEN displaying the table THEN the system SHALL show columns for Concept, Definition, Example, and Documentation Links
3. WHEN rendering the table THEN the system SHALL apply clean, readable styling with proper spacing and borders
4. WHEN the table is displayed THEN the system SHALL make the header row visually distinct from data rows

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter the table by concept names, so that I can quickly find specific AI/ML concepts I'm interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL provide a search input field above the table
2. WHEN I type in the search field THEN the system SHALL filter table rows in real-time based on the concept column
3. WHEN filtering THEN the system SHALL perform case-insensitive matching on the concept names
4. WHEN no matches are found THEN the system SHALL display a "No results found" message
5. WHEN I clear the search field THEN the system SHALL show all table rows again

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the website to work without any external dependencies, so that I can use it offline and it loads quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the solution THEN the system SHALL use only plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. WHEN loading the page THEN the system SHALL not require any external libraries or frameworks
3. WHEN accessing the website THEN the system SHALL work completely offline
4. WHEN the CSV data changes THEN the system SHALL allow easy updating by modifying the embedded data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access additional documentation through clickable links, so that I can learn more about specific concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Documentation Links column contains URLs THEN the system SHALL render them as clickable links
2. WHEN I click on a documentation link THEN the system SHALL open the link in a new tab/window
3. WHEN a documentation link is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL display "N/A" or handle gracefully
4. WHEN rendering links THEN the system SHALL use appropriate styling to indicate they are clickable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the table to be responsive and visually appealing, so that I can use it comfortably on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain table readability
2. WHEN the content is long THEN the system SHALL handle text wrapping appropriately
3. WHEN styling the page THEN the system SHALL use a clean, professional appearance with Material UI colors
